# ALLIVU is a one-stop-shop mobile web application 🏝
For vacationers who want a variety of services but only one organiser. 

### Background
ALLIVU was created as part of the 2-week sprint at the end of the Web Development bootcamp.

### The Why
Designed for vacationers who want a variety of services in one platform, ALLIVU soothes the dizzying array of demands of vacations — informational research, planning activities, practical errands. Search, explore and pay for service vendors, all-in-one place.

> "Looking to rent a vehicle? Hire a private chef? Or book a spa massage? Search, explore and pay for service vendors all-in-one place."
